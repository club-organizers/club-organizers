# Club Organizers

## Problem
UH Mānoa has over 200 student organizations—both official and unofficial—but there is no centralized way for students to:
- Discover what clubs exist
- Learn what they do
- Find out how to get involved

## Solution
Club Organizers is a web application that provides a centralized, searchable directory of all UH Mānoa student clubs.

### Features include:
- Browse clubs by interest area (e.g., art, music, athletics)
- View club descriptions, meeting info, contact details, and photos
- Notifications for new or updated clubs based on user interests

## User Roles
- Regular Users: Browse clubs, customize interests
- Club Admins: Manage and update their own club’s information
- Super Admins: Oversee site content, assign admin roles

## Key Functionalities
- Filter clubs by categories (multiple per club)
- User interest settings trigger notifications
- Admin moderation tools

## Future Enhancements
- Import club data via CSV (from RIO spreadsheet)
- Alert admins when data changes
- Club listing expiration and renewal system
- Club rating system by students

## Example Use Cases
- A new user logs in, sets up their profile, and finds clubs they’re interested in
- A club admin updates their club’s description and meeting schedule
- A super admin approves new clubs and removes inappropriate content
- A user browses clubs filtered by their favorite interest categories
